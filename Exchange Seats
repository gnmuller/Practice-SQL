#Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' 
#names and their corresponding seat ids. 
#The column id is a continuous increment. Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

#Is this asking to move people who are closet?
#Let's say Yes
#So, we are going to skip every other one?
#OKay, I am starting to get the hang of it
