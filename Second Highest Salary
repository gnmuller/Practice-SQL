#Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table. 
#For example, given the Employee table below, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
#If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

----

#OKay first instict is to just write a select *
#Next you want to find the salaries in reverse order, so that's desc
#Next I just want the second highest, so using the limit function
##I can also use the offset function by constrating the table to a limit
#Seems like to get around the null part I can wrap the whole thing in a ifNull Function

SELECT
IFNULL(
  (
  SELECT *
  FROM Employee
  ORDER BY salary DESC
  Limit 1,1
  ), NULL) AS SECONDHIGHEST SALARY
