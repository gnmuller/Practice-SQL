#The Employee table holds all employees. 
#Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

#The Department table holds all departments of the company.

#Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. 
#For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |

#OKay, so it's going to be a join of some kind. 
# I am going to need everything but I will be explict in writing it
#AFter that we are going to need a join statement
#Finally getting the max salary, but this isn't as easy as just finding the total max salaries, it's each department.
#So selecting mutliple values could be a CTE
