#Given a Weather table, 
#write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature
#compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

#I think this may be a good use of CTE's
#Hmm perhaps not
#There has to be a way to compare two things
#But how to do it in one table?
#I don't like how weather is used twice here.

SELECT DISTINCT a.Id
FROM Weather a, Weather b
WHERE a.Temperature > b.Temperature
AND DATEDIFF(a.Recorddate, b.Recorddate) = 1
